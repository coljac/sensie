  abstract = {This paper provides an entry point to the problem of interpreting a deep neural network model and explaining its predictions. It is based on a tutorial given at ICASSP 2017. As a tutorial paper, the set of methods covered here is not exhaustive, but sufficiently representative to discuss a number of questions in interpretability, technical challenges, and possible applications. The second part of the tutorial focuses on the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique, for which we provide theory, recommendations, and tricks, to make most efficient use of it on real data.},

Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a method to compute scores for individual components of an input image, denoting their contribution to the prediction of the classifier for one particular test point. We demonstrate the impact of different choices of decomposition cut-off points during the LRP-process, controlling the resolution and semantics of the heatmap on test images from the PASCAL VOC 2007 test data set.},

  abstract = {Understanding and interpreting classification decisions of automated image classification systems is of high value in many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (automated processes that learn by example in order to classify, predict, discover, or generate new data) and artificial intelligence (methods by which a computer makes decisions or discoveries that would usually require human intelligence) are now firmly established in astronomy. Every week, new applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence are added to a growing corpus of work. Random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are now having a genuine impact for applications as diverse as discovering extrasolar planets, transient objects, quasars, and gravitationally lensed systems, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. This review surveys contemporary, published literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence in astronomy and astrophysics. Applications span seven main categories of activity: classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. These categories form the basis of a hierarchy of maturity, as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence emerges, progresses, or becomes established.

We examine 1175 of the highest-scored candidates and identify 152 probable or definite lenses. Examining an additional 20,000 images with lower scores, we identify a further 247 probable or definite candidates. After including 86 candidates discovered in earlier searches using neural networks and 26 candidates discovered through visual inspection of blue-near-red objects in the DES catalog, we present a catalog of 511 lens candidates.},

  abstract = {We train and apply convolutional neural networks, a machine learning technique developed to learn from and classify image data, to Canada\textendash{}France\textendash{}Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) imaging for the identification of potential strong lensing systems. An ensemble of four convolutional neural networks was trained on images of simulated galaxy\textendash{}galaxy lenses. The training sets consisted of a total of 62~406 simulated lenses and 64~673 non-lens negative examples generated with two different methodologies. An ensemble of trained networks was applied to all of the 171~deg2 of the CFHTLS wide field image data, identifying 18~861 candidates including 63 known and 139 other potential lens candidates. A second search of 1.4 million early-type galaxies selected from the survey catalogue as potential deflectors, identified 2465 candidates including 117 previously known lens candidates, 29 confirmed lenses/high-quality lens candidates, 266 novel probable or potential lenses and 2097 candidates we classify as false positives. For the catalogue-based search we estimate a completeness of 21\textendash{}28~per~cent with respect to detectable lenses and a purity of 15~per~cent, with a false-positive rate of 1 in 671 images tested. We predict a human astronomer reviewing candidates produced by the system would identify 20 probable lenses and 100 possible lenses per hour in a sample selected by the robot. Convolutional neural networks are therefore a promising tool for use in the search for lenses in current and forthcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

In the case of an image classifier, one type of explanation is to identify pixels that strongly influence the final decision. A starting point for this strategy is the gradient of the class score function with respect to the input image. This gradient can be interpreted as a sensitivity map, and there are several techniques that elaborate on this basic idea. This paper makes two contributions: it introduces SmoothGrad, a simple method that can help visually sharpen gradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses lessons in the visualization of these maps.
